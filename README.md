# Malware-Classification-using-Binary-Visualization
Project on Malware classification based on the concept of visualization of binary files of programs


## Dataset
- Binary files of different programs are extracted and converted to RGB images to form Malimg dataset.
- Available  dataset [malimg-grayscale](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/149gz4sygYIJx8P2X9gHvryQNNtTQmr-k?usp=sharing) is converted to RGB images
- Created using the tool [Binvis.io](https://binvis.io)
